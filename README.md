## About <a name = "about"></a>

We planned to animate a car montage using Python scripting in Blender. The initial model (car) will first move forward with the camera up front. The lighting will start from dawn to daylight, matching the scene of the animation. The camera will then shift to different angles, highlighting the details of some parts of the car. The potential impact of this animation (car montage) will enable a scripter to apply the script to different animation concepts using Python in Blender.
